Control the height of an IKEA IDÃ…SEN desk via bluetooth.

Inspiration and, much more importantly, the control codes were taken
from:

    https://github.com/mitsuhiko/idasen-control

There are a couple more similar projects out there, for example:

Installation
------------

You need the tools "bluetoothctl" (bluez-utils) and "gdbus" (glib2). We
expect BlueZ to expose its services via D-Bus. These requirements are
usually fulfilled when run on GNU/Linux, so it's likely that you don't
have to do any installation steps at all.


Running
-------

This is a command line utility. Run it without arguments to view a short
help page. Example calls:

    $ idasen pos
    1345

    $ idasen moveto 4000

Control the height of an IKEA IDÃ…SEN desk via bluetooth.

Inspiration and, much more importantly, the control codes were taken
from:

https://github.com/mitsuhiko/idasen-control/


Installation
------------

You need the tools "bluetoothctl" and "gdbus". We expect BlueZ to expose
its services via D-Bus.


Running
-------

This is a command line utilty. Run it without arguments to view a short
help page. Example calls:

    $ idasen pos
    1345

    $ idasen moveto 4000
